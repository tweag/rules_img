## Quick Start

### Building a Simple Image

Add base image to `MODULE.bazel`:

```starlark
pull = use_repo_rule("@rules_img//img:pull.bzl", "pull")

pull(
    name = "ubuntu",
    digest = "sha256:1e622c5f073b4f6bfad6632f2616c7f59ef256e96fe78bf6a595d1dc4376ac02",
    registry = "index.docker.io",
    repository = "library/ubuntu",
    tag = "24.04",
)

pull(
    name = "cuda",
    digest = "sha256:f353ffca86e0cd93ab2470fe274ecf766519c24c37ed58cc2f91d915f7ebe53c",
    registry = "index.docker.io",
    repository = "nvidia/cuda",
    tag = "12.8.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu20.04",
)
```

Compose images in `BUILD.bazel`:

```starlark
load("@rules_img//img:layer.bzl", "image_layer")
load("@rules_img//img:image.bzl", "image_manifest")

# Create a layer from files
image_layer(
    name = "app_layer",
    srcs = {
        "/app/bin/server": "//cmd/server",
        "/app/config": "//configs:prod",
    },
    compress = "zstd",  # Use zstd compression (optional, uses global default otherwise)
)

# Build a container image
image_manifest(
    name = "app_image",
    base = "@ubuntu", # Optional: build "from scratch" without base.
    layers = [
        ":app_layer",
    ],
    config_fragment = "config.json",  # Optional image configuration, uses sane defaults.
)
```

### Multi-Platform Images

In most cases, you can just use the builtin transitions feature:

```starlark
load("@rules_img//img:image.bzl", "image_manifest", "image_index")

# Create platform-specific images
image_manifest(
    name = "app",
    layers = [":app_layer"],
)

# Combine into multi-platform index
image_index(
    name = "app",
    manifests = [":app_amd"],
    platforms = [
        "//:linux_amd64",
        "//:linux_arm64",
    ],
)
```

### Pushing to a Registry

```starlark
load("@rules_img//img:push.bzl", "image_push")

image_push(
    name = "push",
    image = ":app",
    registry = "ghcr.io",
    repository = "my-project/app",
    tag = "latest",
)
```

Run with:
```bash
bazel run //:push
```

## Comparison with rules_oci

Both `rules_img` and `rules_oci` are modern Bazel rulesets for building OCI container images. While they share the goal of hermetic, reproducible container builds, they take fundamentally different architectural approaches.
`rules_oci` uses the [oci image layout][oci-image-layout] as an on-disk representation of container images at every step (base image pull, `oci_image` rule, `oci_image_index` rule).
Additionally, `rules_oci` chooses to use only off-the-shelf, pre-built tools for assembling images.
`rules_img` chooses to use providers that contain just enough information as needed for subsequent steps. We also use customized tools, instead of prebuilt ones.
This results in a more complex implementation, but also allows for interesting optimizations.

## Key Differences Explained

### Shallow Base Image Pulling

Unlike rules_oci which downloads all layers of a base image, rules_img uses a "shallow pull" approach. When you reference a base image like CUDA (which can be 10+ GB), rules_img only downloads the manifest and config - not the actual layer blobs. The layers are only downloaded when and if they're needed during push operations.

This results in:
- **Faster builds** - No waiting for large base image downloads
- **Reduced bandwidth** - Only download what you actually use
- **True Build-without-the-bytes** - Other rulesets download base layers to your local machine in a repository rule. This step cannot be remotely executed and is repeated on every machine running Bazel.

Example with a large CUDA base image:
```starlark
# This won't download the 10GB of CUDA layers!
pull(
    name = "cuda",
    digest = "sha256:...",
    registry = "index.docker.io",
    repository = "nvidia/cuda",
)
```

### Single Action Layers

rules_img produces both the layer blob and its metadata in a single Bazel action. This design has several advantages:

- **Remote execution friendly** - Single action works better with RBE
- **Image Manifest only depends on metadata** - In rules_oci, image actions depend on the actual blobs of their base image and layers, which must be available during the manifest writing action.

The metadata includes the layer's digest, size, and diff ID, all computed during layer creation.

### Layer Optimization

When writing a tar layer, rules_img uses hardlinks to deduplicate identical files.
This allows for smaller container images.

### Advanced Push Strategies

rules_img offers four sophisticated push strategies compared to rules_oci's traditional approach. These strategies enable:
- **Faster CI/CD** - Avoid unnecesary file transfer
- **Build without the bytes** - Never materialize container layers on your local machine
- **Scalability** - Designed for organizations with thousands of builds per day

| Strategy | Description | Use Case | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| [`eager`](docs/push-strategies.md#eager-push) | Traditional push, download all blobs to the machine running Bazel, then uploads all blobs. | Simple deployments | Normal container registry |
| [`lazy`](docs/push-strategies.md#lazy-push) | Checks registry first, skips existing blobs and streams missing blobs from Bazel's remote cache | Faster CI/CD and Build without the Bytes | Bazel remote cache |
| [`cas_registry`](docs/push-strategies.md#cas-registry-push) | Uses special container registry that is directly connected to Bazel's remote cache | Fast development cycles. | Special container registry (`cmd/registry`), Bazel remote cache |
| [`bes`](docs/push-strategies.md#bes-push) | Image push happens as side-effect of BES upload. Requires self-hosted BES server. | Extremely fast and efficient for large organizations. | Special BES backend (`cmd/bes`), Bazel remote cache |

See the [Push Strategies Guide](docs/push-strategies.md) for detailed information about each strategy.

### eStargz Lazy Pulling

rules_img has first-class support for eStargz (enhanced stargz), enabling "lazy pulling" at container runtime. This means:

- **Instant container starts** - Containers can start before all layers download
- **Bandwidth savings** - Only accessed files are downloaded
- **Seekable layers** - Random access to files within compressed layers

Combined with containerd's stargz-snapshotter, this can reduce container startup time from minutes to seconds for large images.

```starlark
image_layer(
    name = "optimized_layer",
    srcs = {...},
    estargz = "enabled",  # Enable seekable compression
)
```

The same setting can be globally enabled using `--@rules_img//img/settings:estargz=enabled`.
Read the [stargz-snapshotter documentation][stargz-snapshotter] for more information.

### Incremental Loading

rules_img loads images incrementally and efficiently by directly interfacing with the containerd API. This provides significant performance advantages over traditional approaches:

- **Direct containerd integration** - When Docker is configured with containerd storage, rules_img bypasses `docker load` entirely
- **Incremental blob loading** - Only new or changed layers are loaded, existing blobs are skipped
- **Streaming architecture** - No temporary tar files or buffering entire images in memory
- **Platform selection** - Load only the platforms you need from multi-platform images

The performance difference is dramatic, especially for large images:

```bash
# Load only the platform you need
bazel run //my:image_load -- --platform linux/amd64

# Incremental loading: only new layers are transferred
# Second load of a slightly modified image is near-instant
bazel run //my:image_load  # Only changed layers loaded!
```

When Docker doesn't support containerd storage, rules_img automatically falls back to `docker load` with a clear warning about the performance impact.

This is particularly powerful in development workflows where you're iterating on application layers while keeping large base images (like CUDA) unchanged - subsequent loads only transfer your small application layers.

**Future Docker Support**: Docker is planning to expose its contentstore API in version 29.0.0, which will enable native incremental loading ([moby/moby#44369](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/44369)). Once this ships, rules_img will adopt it to provide incremental loading performance even when the containerd socket isn't directly accesible by users. This will bring the same efficiency benefits to all Docker users, regardless of their platform or configuration.

Special thanks to **Sushain Cherivirala** from Stripe for the inspiring BazelCon talk ["Building 1300 Container Images in 4 Minutes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-yvIQooOSA). This talk introduced the groundbreaking idea of using the Build Event Service (BES) to sync container images between the remote cache and registry as a side effect. While their implementation was based on the now-archived rules_docker and was never published, it laid the conceptual foundation for our BES push strategy. Their work demonstrated how to achieve dramatic performance improvements in container image builds at scale, inspiring many of the optimizations in rules_img.
